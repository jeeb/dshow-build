For the next beta:
    * Update ffdshow-tryouts
        - See trunk changes to default settings.
        - Switch AAC, AC3, DTS, MP3 to lavc.
        - Test >2ch wavpack.
        - Check if NV12 is needed for anything
        - Enable yadif std rate deinterlacing
          for interlaced sources.
        - Otherwise everything as usual.
        
        - Is the revert of r2997 really needed?
        
        (Should be mostly ready for 64bit,
         libav is mostly green on win64)
    * Update MPC-HC
        - See trunk changes to default settings.
        - Otherwise same as usual.
        
        (One of the problems for a 64bit pack,
         lack of developers and old ffmpeg make
         this somewhat of a dirty bomb)
    * Update Haali
        - Make Haali only default for MKV
    * FLVSplitter
        - Has served its purpose
        - Can be left as backup
    * LAVSplitter (and LAVAudio)
        - A prominent open source splitter.
        - Enable for FLV, MP4, MPEG-TS.
        - Should work better than Haali, but
          testing needed.
        - Certain audio formats with ffdshow-tryouts
          need specific hacks, enable LAVAudio for
          those when used with LAVSplitter.
    * MPEG2DecFilter
        - As-is, just update with MPC-HC
    * VSFilter
        - Check if basefilter reverts are still needed.
    * CoreWavPack
        - As-is, if wavpack works fine with ffdshow-tryouts
          remove from defaults.
    
    * Installer (inno)
        
    
    * Settings app (nullsoft)
